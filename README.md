# spotify-lyrics
This is a small project, experimenting with the Spotify API and using spotipy to get the lyrics for the currently listened to song.

This involves using web scraping to get the lyrics for the current song (title and artist).

The overall functionality works with the majority of songs, but I am working on fixing bugs for some of the songs.
